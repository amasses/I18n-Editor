== I18n Editor ==

Editing YAML files by hand is such a pain, so I decided to create a simple Rails app to do this.

Yes, I suppose this would be more lightweight as a Sinatra app, or a Rack app, or whatever, but hey, this is
what I chose to do.

If you want to make any changes, improvements, polish up the design... feel free :)
